      So don’t pass gas fees on this one or else you’ll miss out on comedy gold.

      Get it?

    <p className="pb-7">
      If not, that's great.

    <p className="pb-7">
      We need more people not into crypto to really get it.

    <p className="pb-7">
      So do you get it yet?

    <p className="pb-3">
      What light-hearted meme tokens are really about?

      Either way let's bring that light to your heart, so this world gets smart.

    <p className='pb-10'>
      We used to have a monetary system backed by gold, yet in this digital age it’s truly about that comedy gold.<br />
      <br />
      It’s how we make you and your friends laugh, and the shiniest meme tokens with hearts of gold help you swallow that crypto pill.<br />
      <br/>
      So swallow whole, with these holy vibes, cause this world's ill.<br />
      <br />
      Currency itself is a shared belief system, its value is defined based on how we value it.<br />
      <br />
      Gold worked great for this until 1971 when the US decided to stop being limited by a gold reserve. At this time, the biggest shit coin was born.<br />
      <br />
      Thus, an ultimate source of power was formed. The ability to literally print money.<br />    
      <br />
      And around it an oasis of corruption is inevitable.<br />
      <br />
      Any instrument so powerful, that the greediest people alive all seek it, becomes evil lurking who would do anything to protect it.<br />
      <br />
      From corruption to cabal, this is where the collective idea of an evil mafia came from.<br />
      <br />
      Collective idea, huh, that's exactly what a meme is after all.<br />
      <br />
      And this meme is real, except rather than an old-school town mafia, this one has the money printer, and thus runs the world.<br />
      <br />
      Unlimited funding can make most problems go away, and now it gave those with the power to do so a reason to print.<br /> 
      <br />
      Because printing money is key for war, and safety.<br /> 
      <br />
      Make the world less safe?<br /> 
      Start a global pandemic?<br />
      Start proxy wars?<br />
      <br />
      A good reason to print money, is a bad thing for us.<br />
      <br />
      Incentives are kinda like assholes, they get extra shitty when they’re not maintained.<br /> 
      <br />
      Bad incentives lead to bad actors printing trillions of cents.<br />  
      <br />
      But right now, we're just making sense of it all.<br />
      <br />
      This exact understanding was what led the pioneers of Bitcoin and its early supporters into action.<br /> 
      <br />
      Led by something bigger than money… a cure to the mafia's greatest ally, the printing machine, whose side effects are best found if you search up WTF happened in 1971, the year we created that bitch.<br />
      <br />
      So you may wonder the recent rally at hand, well, while a certain bank man fried crypto for a bit, the inevitable nature of its existence has steamrolled into the hearts, minds, and wallets of the mafia itself.<br />
      <br />
      There’s been a vibe shift.<br />
      <br />
      Bitcoin is the gunshot heard around the world.<br />
      <br />
      Mafia members grabbed their own share and now with a profit incentive pushed gigantic financial institutions into their investment.<br />
      <br />
      What they may or may not realize, is this greed will ultimately be their downfall.<br />
      <br />
      Many of the corrupt, are just broken souls, so with the chance to repent “if you can’t beat em, join em” became self evident.<br />
      <br />
      And great, if Bitcoin wins they lose the printing power, but does it really have the narrative? The better question is to ask, would they have ever let it get this big if it did?<br />
      <br />
      The horse and carriage started the race, but with Uranus we can reach the finish.<br />   
      <br />
      I'd say its the perfect resistance.<br />
      <br />
      Sounds tight, right?<br />
     
      <hr className="my-7" />
      <br /> 
      Jokes aside,<br /> 
      Uranus represents an astronomical tool to make our global mafia's power take a big fat dump.<br />   
      <br />
      If this video is your first time understanding the power of the meme token revolution, the first token you’ve seen to actually go deep, a token representing cosmic memeing beyond dog coin.<br />
      <br />
      Then you get where this all flushes out.<br />
      <br />
      From here on out, let it be embedded into your brain, every time you wipe your ass and see that shit stain.<br />
      <br />
      You can remember to be grateful for brown paper that helped Uranus become the cosmic flute that’s going to ring up the global mafia's source of power and take start dumping their control mechanism.<br />
    
      <hr className='my-7'/>
      Truly, every dollar from fiat to the crypto world, is in fact a dump on corruption controlled money supplies. <br />
      <br />
So don’t fee ought, fear not, because the Bitcoin whitepaper was truly just the beginning.   <br />
<br />
Life is not so black or white, and at the end of the day we all leave the same skid mark on our world.    <br />
<br />
So let this be a rally cry for humanity to collectively realize we are the shit, for then we may repeat history and live in a world by the people, and for the people once again.  <br />
<br />
The revolution will not be televised, it will be memed.   <br />    
<br />
This is our bustin token party, this is our roman empire. <br />
<br />
Fought not with blades, bullets, or bombs, butt jokes. <br />
<br />
So right now we invite Ur anus to be revolutionary, and share this cellestial dump with anyone who deserves a laugh, at the expense of the new world order.  <br />  
<br />
Its time to let golden memes light up the world, because central banking digital currencies simply can not.   <br />
<br />
Remember, it’s written in the stars. <br />
